WTL modified for Win8/VS2012
============================

The [WTL submodule](https://github.com/akirill/wtl) used by
[Console2](https://github.com/bozho/console) did not work on Win8/VS2012 when
I tried to build it.

This repo is based on a newer (maybe not official) version of WTL and includes
changes I've done to do to get Console2 to build.

I do not care for Windows XP compability and breaking changes most certainly
will occur.

This repo is provided for *my* convenience.  
It works on my machine.  
Use it at your own risk.
